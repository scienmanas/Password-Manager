# Password-Manager

This is a GUI based offline password Manager built by using tkinter libraray
It stores password in .json format, also it can suggest some good passwords that you can use as your password for a website

If the codes gives error try to change the path of the logo.png and json files in the main.py file which is imported. I used raw string for paths, So change the relative path accordingly 

This can be used to save passwords with username/email of varius websites, also it generates a random assword everytime if needed by the user, once the generate password button is pressed, it automatically copies the generated password on the clipboard.
